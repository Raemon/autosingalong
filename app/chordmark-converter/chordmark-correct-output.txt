Verse 1

 |C                 Am          |

I heard there was a secret chord

    |C                   Am              |

That David played and it pleased the lord

   |F...                      G.    |C      G |

But you don't really care for music, do you?

       |C..                F.          G.   |

Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth

   |Am                 F         |

The minor fall and the major lift

   |G               E7         |Am   |

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Verse 2

          |C                        Am          |

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof

   |C               Am         |

You saw her bathing on the roof

   |F...                     G. |C        G |

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

   |C..             F.      G.   |

She tied you to her kitchen chair

   |Am                        F            |

She broke your throne and she cut your hair

   |G                  E7           |Am   |

And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
